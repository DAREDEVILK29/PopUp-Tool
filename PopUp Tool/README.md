## Problems This Extension Solves

1. It has always been a hassle to get definitions, summaries, and explanations. For instance:
   - To get a definition, you often have to open a new tab, type or paste the word, and search for it.
   - Summarizing or explaining a text or code can be time-consuming and repetitive.

2. With PopUp-Tool, browsing becomes easier and less tiring:
   - You don't have to open a new tab or paste your content into a chatbot or application.
   - PopUp-Tool allows summarizing, defining, explaining, and translating with just a right-click, saving time and effort.

3. Many summarizing extensions rely on AI but:
   - They force you to open a new tab and create an account to use them.
   - It can take 2-5 minutes to get a summary or explanation.

4. Using Google's built-in AI (Prompt API) in PopUp-Tool:
   - You can summarize and more with Prompt API's content generator
   - Get results while sitting in the worst humanly possible posture!

5. PopUp-Tool helps non-native speakers learn languages or understand articles/blog posts easily, with no extra stepsâ€”just a RIGHT CLICK!

### Notes:
- Some text or selections may not work if they are too complex for Prompt API to handle and might return an error. Proper error handling has been ensured to manage such scenarios.
- As Prompt API and other AI technologies are still in early stages, generated responses might not always be accurate.
- This project/extension is a demonstration of how built-in AIs like Prompt API can be utilized to make browsing easier.
